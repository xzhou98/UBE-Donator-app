# UBE-Donator app
 UBE Donator is open-source software developed with support from NSF grant #2211897. This project aims to improve our understanding of how online interactions lead to real-world sexual violence by examining how digital communication shapes the exchange and interpretation of sexual consent. The UBE Donator app supports large-scale, privacy-preserving data collection by following best practices for reporting sexual experiences. It provides researchers with a reliable, ethical way to study harm in computer-mediated settings.
